# PyCtr - An full-fledged implementation of a geometrically exact model for concentric tube continuum robots in Python
This repository contains an implementation of [A Geometrically Exact Model for Externally Loaded Concentric-Tube Continuum Robots - Rucker et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5559519) and was inspired by the code repository of [John D. Till](https://github.com/JohnDTill/ContinuumRobotExamples).
The goal of this project is to provide a fully functional and understandable implementation of this model for educational and research purposes. 
The project is still under developement, but issues with wishes and suggestions for improvement are very welcome.
A documentation is available by calling `make html` in the doc folder.

# Futur Plans
- [ ] Improve Documentation
- [ ] Available on PyPI
- [ ] Extension to the dynamic models
